### TypeScript Command Line Application - Cars, Motorbikes, or Trucks
A command line application for different vehicles and their actions.

## Description
Typscript Command Line Application - Cars, Motorbikes, or Trucks, or as CMT (as I have been referring to it). This is a command line application in which users imput either a new car, or use and existing one. They are able to perform actions with their vehicle and then they are able to play again after each round finishes.

## Installation
Open terminal on Mac OS, or bash on windows. Cd to the directory of ts-cli-cmt and type 'run start'. This should prompt terminal and or bash to begin the app.

## Usage
Create a new vehicle or use an existing one. If you select create a new one, there will be several prompts to answer such as what type of vehicle, VIN number, color, make, model, etc. Each vehicle has specific questions for each. Once the user chooses their vehicle, then they are able to do actions with the vehicle. This continues until the user exits.
